## Profile

I am an Artificial Intelligence and Data Science student with strong software engineering foundations and hands-on experience building production-grade mobile applications.

My work sits at the intersection of engineering rigor and mathematical reasoning. I actively develop cross-platform applications using Flutter while deepening my understanding of algorithms, database systems, probability, and statistical modeling — core pillars of AI systems.

I am particularly interested in scalable systems, intelligent software, and the long-term evolution of AI engineering.
